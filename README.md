This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript involving the GetObject() function.  The GetObject() function can fail if the specified object is unavailable or if the user lacks the required permissions. This example shows how to handle potential errors gracefully to prevent script crashes. The solution improves error handling to provide a more robust and user-friendly experience.
