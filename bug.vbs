Function GetObject() is used to get an object, but it may fail if the object does not exist or if the user does not have the necessary permissions to access it. This can lead to unexpected errors or crashes, especially when the function is called within a larger script or application.  Example:

```vbscript
Dim objFSO
Set objFSO = GetObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
If Err.Number <> 0 Then
  MsgBox "Error accessing FileSystemObject: " & Err.Description
  WScript.Quit
End If
```

This code attempts to get a FileSystemObject. If it fails, an error message is displayed. However, a more robust solution is needed if other parts of the script depend on the FileSystemObject.
